# Parity: dish-windows against the other Dish clients

> **What this is.** The feature-parity ledger for this client, kept as a small
> matrix rather than a per-pull-request diary. The diary form went stale the
> moment a wave was ported in one PR without a row per Android PR, and by
> 2026-09-20 it had not been touched since 2026-08-18 while 24 Android PRs
> landed. A matrix cannot go stale that way: **a PR that changes a row updates
> this file in the same change**, and a reviewer checks the row, not the diary.
>
> Test coverage is no longer mapped file-by-file here. The Catch2 suite under
> `tests/` is the coverage truth and CI runs it on every push; the old
> android-test-file map claimed 0 missing rows and said nothing a green suite
> does not.

> Legend: ✅ works · ⚠️ shipped, not yet verified on real hardware · ❌ not
> available · – not applicable. Verified against the code on 2026-09-29.

## 1. What works, per client

| Feature | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Satellite host, protocol 3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Moonlight host (Sunshine / Apollo / Wolf) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mouse mode on the host | ✅ | ❌ (deferred: `reducer::kClientRoutesTouchpadAsMouse`) | ❌ |
| Controller audio (mic + speaker) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DualSense HD haptics | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Adaptive triggers, player LEDs, mic lamp | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Lightbar, motion, touchpad, battery | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Crash reports (opt-out) | ✅ Crashlytics | ✅ Sentry | ✅ Sentry |
| Update notice | – Play (the store updates it) · ✅ GitHub build | ✅ | ✅ |
| Runs in the background / window closed | ❌ (streaming stops when the app leaves the screen) | ✅ tray | ✅ tray |
| Survives PC sleep and resume | – | ✅ Satellite · ❌ Moonlight | ✅ Satellite · ❌ Moonlight |
| Keep-awake is user-configurable | ❌ (always on while streaming) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Diagnostics screen | ✅ | ✅ (rumble-only bench, see §5) | ✅ (rumble-only bench, see §5) |
| Link-tier cue on host rows (Fastest / Fast / Basic) | ✅ (on the section header) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Protocol chip ("Satellite update recommended / required", "Dish update required") | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| App-wide microphone chip with mute-all | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Capability verdict word "Supported" | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pairing secrets stored encrypted | ✅ Moonlight key (Keystore) · ❌ Satellite key (app-private prefs) | ✅ DPAPI | ✅ Satellite key (Secret Service, else a 0600 file) · ❌ Moonlight key (0600 file) |

## 2. Input, pad → host, by path (cell = USB Direct · USB Standard · Bluetooth)

| | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buttons, sticks, triggers | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ |
| Motion | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Touchpad | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Battery | ⚠️ · ✅ · ✅ | ⚠️ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ⚠️ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Controller mic | ✅ · ✅ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |

The Battery row is what the host is sent. Over USB that is the phone's or PC's
own battery, which a wired pad draws on; the desktops' Standard path sends
SDL's coarse pad level instead whenever SDL reports one. Over Bluetooth the
desktops send SDL's coarse pad level (the PC's battery when SDL has none), and
Android the lower of the pad's and the phone's.

## 3. Receiving, host → pad, by path (cell = USB Direct · USB Standard · Bluetooth)

| | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rumble | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Lightbar | ✅ · ❌ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Adaptive triggers | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ |
| Player LEDs | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ |
| Mic lamp | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |
| Controller speaker | ✅ · ✅ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |
| HD haptics | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ |

The Android Standard column is ❌ for lightbar, triggers, LEDs and the lamp
because the framework has no API for them over USB; the desktop Bluetooth
column is ⚠️ because SDL's HIDAPI driver only opens a Bluetooth Sony pad in
enhanced mode since the 2026-09-20 wave and nobody has paired one against it.

## 4. Which controllers can use USB Direct (Bluetooth is never Direct)

| Controller | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| DualShock 4 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DualSense (+Edge on desktop) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Switch Pro | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Generic PDP Switch pads | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 8BitDo | ✅ known XInput models | ✅ in HID mode (generic HID parser); Standard only in XInput mode (XUSB owns it) | ✅ in HID mode (generic HID parser); Standard only in XInput mode (xpad owns it) |
| Xbox 360 / One / Series wired | ✅ | ❌ Standard only (XUSB owns it) | ❌ Standard only (xpad owns it) |
| Stadia | ✅ | ⚠️ generic HID parser, manual pick | ⚠️ generic HID parser, manual pick |
| Steam Controller | ✅ | ⚠️ never verified | ⚠️ never verified |

## 5. Decisions, not gaps

- Android's on-screen pad takes controller audio from the phone's own mic and
  speaker. A physical pad, on every client, uses only its own USB endpoints and
  refuses on ambiguity; a Bluetooth pad gets none.
- Xbox Direct exists only on Android: XUSB owns those pads here.
- Virtual-pad skins, lightbar wash, cutout theme, Play billing, store
  screenshots: phone-only by nature.
- Android's keep-awake is fixed (screen and wake lock while streaming); the
  desktop setting is about PC sleep, a different problem.
- Mouse mode on desktop is a recorded deferral, not an oversight.
- The Android protocol chip keys on the satellite's advertised version and
  reads "Dish update required" for a newer satellite that still accepts this
  build; this client keys the chip on the negotiation, so that case reads as
  fine. Red here means the session cannot open.
- The Diagnostics page leaves out these parts of Android's. Screen hold:
  keep-awake is the user's own setting here, and a page that held the display
  would be a second writer to the same inhibitor. The latency profiling bench:
  the desktop input path carries no per-stage timestamps, so the page shows the
  session's measured round trip instead. Host cards for Moonlight and Bluetooth
  hosts: every fact the desktop holds about a Moonlight session already renders
  on the Moonlight hosts page, the host app and GFE versions and per-pad report
  counts Android adds have no desktop source, and this client never pairs to a
  host as a Bluetooth gamepad. A controller bound to a Moonlight host still
  names it.
- Of Android's three radio cards the page shows Bluetooth, with the adapter's
  state; that card's permission, link-type and host-role rows have no desktop
  counterpart. The Wi-Fi card is left out because the desktop has no WLAN
  source, and the USB card because each controller card already shows its path
  and poll rate, while the endpoint packet facts Android adds have no desktop
  source.
- The Diagnostics feature bench drives rumble only, through the ungated path, so
  a pad whose rumble switch is off can still be tested. The lightbar, player
  LEDs, trigger effects and mic lamp are host-owned state a test would
  overwrite, and the lamp is the mute indicator. Controller audio has no test
  tone in the desktop engines.
- The Diagnostics event log is localized like every other desktop string: the
  C++ vends tokens and the QML words them. Android keeps its log in English as
  export material for bug reports.
