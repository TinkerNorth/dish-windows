# Parity: dish-windows against the other Dish clients

> **What this is.** The feature-parity ledger for this client, kept as a small

## 2. Input, pad → host, by path (cell = USB Direct · USB Standard · Bluetooth)

| | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buttons, sticks, triggers | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ |
| Motion | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Touchpad | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Battery | ⚠️ · ✅ · ✅ | ⚠️ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ⚠️ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Controller mic | ✅ · ✅ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |

The Battery row is what the host is sent: the lower of the pad's own reading
and the PC's battery, on every path and to a Moonlight host too, and the PC's
alone when the pad reports none. A wired pad that reports its own charge
competes like any other, a tie goes to the pad, and an unknown level loses to
a known one. Direct reads the pad's charge from its own report; Standard and
Bluetooth read SDL's coarse level, which SDL leaves unknown for a pad it sees
as wired. The controller card keeps showing the pad's own reading. Android
applies the same rule with the phone's battery.

## 3. Receiving, host → pad, by path (cell = USB Direct · USB Standard · Bluetooth)

| | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rumble | ✅ · ✅ · ✅ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Lightbar | ✅ · ❌ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ✅ · ⚠️ |
| Adaptive triggers | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ |
| Player LEDs | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ⚠️ |
| Mic lamp | ✅ · ❌ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |
| Controller speaker | ✅ · ✅ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ✅ · ⚠️ · ❌ |
| HD haptics | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ | ⚠️ · ⚠️ · ❌ |

The Android Standard column is ❌ for lightbar, triggers, LEDs and the lamp
because the framework has no API for them over USB; the desktop Bluetooth
column is ⚠️ because SDL's HIDAPI driver only opens a Bluetooth Sony pad in
enhanced mode since the 2026-09-20 wave and nobody has paired one against it.

## 4. Which controllers can use USB Direct (Bluetooth is never Direct)

| Controller | Android | Windows (this) | Linux |
|---|---|---|---|
| DualShock 4 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DualSense (+Edge on desktop) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Switch Pro | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Generic PDP Switch pads | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| 8BitDo | ✅ known XInput models | ✅ in HID mode (generic HID parser); Standard only in XInput mode (XUSB owns it) | ✅ in HID mode (generic HID parser); Standard only in XInput mode (xpad owns it) |
| Xbox 360 / One / Series wired | ✅ | ❌ Standard only (XUSB owns it) | ❌ Standard only (xpad owns it) |
| Stadia | ✅ | ⚠️ generic HID parser, manual pick | ⚠️ generic HID parser, manual pick |
| Steam Controller (2015) | ✅ | ⚠️ never verified; each controller on the receiver a pad of its own (see below) | ⚠️ never verified; each controller on the receiver a pad of its own |
| Steam Controller (2026) | ❌ | ⚠️ never verified, ported from SDL (see below) | ⚠️ never verified, ported from SDL |

The 2026 Steam Controller (wired `28DE:1302`, dongles `28DE:1304` and
`28DE:1305`) is ported from SDL's driver (`SDL_hidapi_steam_triton.c`) and no
pad has been on hand. Like the 2015 pad it is never claimed on its own, only
through a Direct pick on its card. Its output worker sends the quiet settings
(lizard mode off, raw accelerometer and gyro on) at the claim and every 3 s,
because the pad's firmware turns lizard mode back on otherwise, and repeats a
running rumble every 40 ms, because the pad stops one on its own. Open
follow-ups: the two trackpads, the four back paddles, the quick-access button,
the trigger and trackpad clicks and the capacitive touches have no wire field
and are not forwarded; and the Bluetooth identity (`28DE:1303`) is never
Direct, like every Bluetooth pad.

A Steam Controller receiver (the 2015 `28DE:1142`, the 2026 `28DE:1304` and
`28DE:1305`) serves up to four paired controllers, one HID interface each: 1 to
4 on the 2015 receiver, its keyboard on 0, and 2 to 5 on the 2026 ones (SDL's
`HIDAPI_DriverSteam_IsSupportedDevice` and
`HIDAPI_DriverSteamTriton_IsSupportedDevice`, the Linux kernel's
`steam_is_valve_interface`), read here from the `&mi_XX` part of each
collection's path. The Direct pick is the receiver's and claims every slot, all
of them or none. A slot is a pad of its own, with its own card and binding,
while its controller is there: from its connect event (the 2015 pad's
`ID_CONTROLLER_WIRELESS`, connected or newly paired, the 2026 pad's
`0x46`/`0x79`) or its first report, until its disconnect event, which the next
1 s scan turns into the card appearing or leaving. An empty slot stays claimed
to listen and is no pad; while no controller is on, the receiver keeps its own
card, which says so. The receiver's card carries the path toggle only and offers
no binding or type pick (`bindable` in `docs/QML_CONTRACT.md`): it stands for
the receiver, not for a pad, and its id is no pad's. A controller's binding and
type are picked on its own card, which keeps them across the controller turning
off and on. A slot's id is its interface, so a controller that comes back lands
on its card and its Moonlight binding; a satellite binding leaves with the
controller, as it does for any pad that goes, and never moves onto another
slot's. Its battery reading leaves with it too, and is shown again as soon as
the controller is back, changed or not. The 2015 receiver's slot is asked what
it holds (`ID_DONGLE_GET_WIRELESS_STATE`) when it opens, the request SDL and
hid-steam both send; the answer is read off the slot's input stream the way
SDL's `HIDAPI_DriverSteam_InitDevice` reads it, where hid-steam's
`steam_get_conn_status` reads it back as a feature report. Its controller is
quieted when it arrives. No receiver has been on hand: how an empty slot answers
the feature reports (the 2015 state request, the 2026 pad's 3 s settings) is
unverified.

## 5. Decisions, not gaps

- Android's on-screen pad takes controller audio from the phone's own mic and
  speaker. A physical pad, on every client, uses only its own USB endpoints and
  refuses on ambiguity; a Bluetooth pad gets none.
- Xbox Direct exists only on Android: XUSB owns those pads here.
- Virtual-pad skins, lightbar wash, cutout theme, Play billing, store
  screenshots: phone-only by nature.
- Android's keep-awake is fixed (screen and wake lock while streaming); the
  desktop setting is about PC sleep, a different problem.
- Mouse mode on desktop is a recorded deferral, not an oversight.
- The Android protocol chip keys on the satellite's advertised version and
  reads "Dish update required" for a newer satellite that still accepts this
  build; this client keys the chip on the negotiation, so that case reads as
  fine. Red here means the session cannot open.
- The Diagnostics page leaves out these parts of Android's. Screen hold:
  keep-awake is the user's own setting here, and a page that held the display
  would be a second writer to the same inhibitor. The latency profiling bench:
  the desktop input path carries no per-stage timestamps, so the page shows the
  session's measured round trip instead. Host cards for Moonlight and Bluetooth
  hosts: every fact the desktop holds about a Moonlight session already renders
  on the Moonlight hosts page, the host app and GFE versions and per-pad report
  counts Android adds have no desktop source, and this client never pairs to a
  host as a Bluetooth gamepad. A controller bound to a Moonlight host still
  names it.
- Of Android's three radio cards the page shows Bluetooth, with the adapter's
  state; that card's permission, link-type and host-role rows have no desktop
  counterpart. The Wi-Fi card is left out because the desktop has no WLAN
  source, and the USB card because each controller card already shows its path
  and poll rate, while the endpoint packet facts Android adds have no desktop
  source.
- The Diagnostics feature bench drives rumble only, through the ungated path, so
  a pad whose rumble switch is off can still be tested. The lightbar, player
  LEDs, trigger effects and mic lamp are host-owned state a test would
  overwrite, and the lamp is the mute indicator. Controller audio has no test
  tone in the desktop engines.
- The Diagnostics event log is localized like every other desktop string: the
  C++ vends tokens and the QML words them. Android keeps its log in English as
  export material for bug reports.
