# Input path benchmark

`bench_input_path` measures the dish's input send path on Windows: a controller report leaving the
thread that read it, through the processor, the routing, the session and the seal, until its
datagram reaches a satellite. It runs the real objects in process against loopback satellites, so it
needs no network, no satellite and, in its default mode, no controller. `bench_input_path_lockstats`
is the same bench in a `DISH_LOCK_STATS` build, and adds what every lock was asked for by which
thread. These numbers are the record the hot-path work is measured against; the lock-law test
(`tests/test_lock_laws.cpp`) pins which locks each thread takes, this bench says what they cost.

## The path

| # | Stage | What it is | Locks it takes today |
|---|-------|------------|----------------------|
| 0 | SDL thread | `SDL_WaitEventTimeout` (SDL polls pads on a 1 ms `Sleep` loop), then `rebuildState` per controller event: the device maps, the twin-suppression set, 21 SDL getters. Each axis change also arrives as a raw joystick event, which the bridge looks up and drops, and the loop drains the output queue and polls batteries after both | per report: `bridge.devices` 4 times, `bridge.output` twice, `bridge.suppressed` once |
| 0' | Raw-HID read thread | a Direct pad's overlapped `ReadFile`, the decoder, then `UsbGamepadManager`'s report sink, which publishes input, motion (at most 250 Hz) and touchpad (every report) | none of its own |
| 1 | Processor | `GamepadInputProcessor::publish`: dead zones, five map operations, the sender copied | `input.processor` |
| 2 | Routing | AppModel's report sender: `QString::fromStdString`, a `QHash` lookup and a `std::function` copy, then Moonlight's relaxed load | `app.routing` |
| 3 | Session | the hub's closure to `WifiConnection::sendReport`, which reads the bound slot and takes the client | `wifi.client` |
| 4 | Seal and send | `SatelliteClient::sendEncrypted`: two `std::vector`s, the session material, ChaCha20-Poly1305, `sendto` | `satellite.material`, then `satellite.send` held across `sendto` |
| 5 | Loopback satellite | the bench's: `recvfrom`, the stamp, then the decrypt and the sequence | none (apparatus) |

Synthetic mode times stages 1 to 4 (plus the loopback hop) from the moment a producer publishes;
ViGEm mode adds stage 0 and the driver in front of it. The receive side runs as background load in
S4 to S7: the session's receive thread decrypts each rumble and light-bar datagram and routes it
through AppModel's feedback route to the SDL output queue, taking `satellite.material`,
`satellite.handlers`, `hub.bindings`, `store.observable`, `bridge.devices` (twice),
`app.audioRoutes` and `bridge.output`.

## How it is measured

### Synthetic mode

The wiring is `tests/HotPathRig.h`, which the lock-law test uses too. The processor, the SDL bridge,
the hub, the `WifiConnectionManager` sessions, the `SatelliteClient`s, the USB manager, the rumble
and motion stores, the Moonlight manager and the playout engine are the production classes. Each
session goes live through the manager's real session PUT over the scripted REST fake, and its UDP
link opens to a loopback satellite that derives the same session key, decrypts every datagram, acks
every ping and sends feedback back. **AppModel itself is not built:** it owns the tray icon, the
real settings, the wake inhibitor and the update coordinator, so the harness cannot instantiate it.
Its glue is mirrored verbatim in the rig's `AppGlue`: the four processor senders (the report sender
is `src/AppModel.cpp:202-216`), `republishRouting`, and the feedback route from `onRumbleMessage`
and `onLightbarMessage` through `feedbackInputs` to the bridge or the USB manager. A change to that
glue in AppModel must be made to `AppGlue` as well.

The pads are SDL virtual game controllers that the real bridge has opened, so their dead zones,
rumble and light bar are what the bridge decided for them, and a rumble routes to the SDL output
queue as it would for a real pad. The producer publishes straight into the processor, so the SDL
thread's own work (stage 0) is not in a synthetic figure; ViGEm mode has it. Each report carries a
sequence on the right stick's X axis, encoded as 4096 plus the frame index mod 28672, because the
bridge's stick dead zone zeroes |v| <= 3277 (`tests/test_bench_support.cpp` checks the encoding
against `deadzone::applyStick`). The producer stamps `steady_clock` just before `publish`; the
loopback satellite stamps it just after `recvfrom` returns; the latency is the difference, on one
clock. A measured session's satellite thread spins on a non-blocking socket while a run is open, as
the satellite's own receive loop does, so its wake-up is not in the figure; `--receiver block` blocks
it in `recvfrom` instead, at `THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL`, for a small machine.

Every producer works to absolute deadlines: frame `k` of a stream is due `k` periods after the
common start, whatever happened to frame `k - 1`. It sleeps on a high-resolution waitable timer
(`CREATE_WAITABLE_TIMER_HIGH_RESOLUTION`, falling back to `Sleep` while more than a 15.6 ms tick
remains) until 800 us before the deadline, then spins. The GUI thread is the bench's main thread,
which runs Qt's loop at 200 Hz on the same pacer and does the GUI's work there.

| scenario | what runs |
|---|---|
| S1 | pad A at `--rate` (1000 Hz), nothing else |
| S2 | S1 plus pad B at 250 Hz, published by the same SdlInput thread, as the one SDL thread serves every pad. A dish binds one pad per satellite session (`ConnectionHub::bind` evicts the slot already bound to the connection, and `WifiConnection::sendReport` sends only for its bound slot), so pad B streams to a second session |
| S3 | S2 plus the GUI while a pad plays: routing republish every 100 ms, `devices()` every 100 ms, `inspect()` at 30 Hz, `inputCounters()` at 1 Hz |
| S4 | S3 plus 100 rumbles and 10 light-bar colours a second from pad A's satellite to the receive thread, which routes them to the SDL output queue ("queued for SDL") |
| S5 | S4 plus the session's heartbeat thread (a ping every 2 s, acked) and an AudioCapture thread sending mic frames at `--mic-hz` (50) through the hub's mic sender on pad A's session; `S5 (mic 1000 Hz)` is the `--mic-hz 1000` run |
| S6 | a Direct DualSense alone: a UsbReader thread hands `UsbGamepadManager`'s report sink a full USB DualSense report (input, motion, touchpad and battery valid, as the decoder leaves them) at `--rate`, on a third session |
| S7 | S4 plus the GUI binding and unbinding pad C on a fourth session every 200 ms, the desktop's equivalent of the satellite's 200 ms plug |

The heartbeat threads are stopped outside S5, so S5 is the only scenario with heartbeat traffic.
Each scenario runs `--secs` (3) seconds, `--reps` (3) times, interleaved after a discarded warm-up
pass of at most a second each, and the table shows the rep whose p99.9 of its first producer is the
median. `frames` counts the reports that arrived; `over 1 ms` counts those slower than 1 ms;
`longest gap ms` is the longest wait between two arrivals of that producer; `dgrams/report` is the
session's input, motion, touchpad and battery datagrams over the reports sent; `drops` is sent minus
arrived.

### ViGEm mode

`--mode vigem` plugs an Xbox 360 pad through ViGEmClient, starts the real `SDLGamepadBridge`, binds
the bridge's new device to a session and drives the pad at `--rate`. Each stimulus report puts the
sequence on the right stick's X axis and moves its Y axis too, as a real stick does; the stimulus
thread stamps each submit, an XInput spinner on the slot whose state shows a probe value (so real
pads on other slots are left alone) stamps when the state shows each sequence, and the loopback
satellite stamps its datagram. `submit to visible` is ViGEmBus and XInput; `visible to recv` is
SDL's sampling plus stages 0 to 4; `submit to recv` is the two together. `drops` here counts
stimulus reports that never left the dish because SDL's 1 ms poll sampled a later one first, and
`effective Hz` is the reports a second the satellite saw. Without ViGEmBus the mode prints why and
exits 0. The SDK is ViGEm/ViGEmClient v1.21.222.0, the version the satellite targets
(`satellite/lib/VENDORED.md`), fetched by `tools/bench/CMakeLists.txt` pinned to commit
`9e842ba1c3a6efbb90d9b7e9346a55b1a3d10494`; upstream is archived, its HEAD is `b66d02d`.

### Lock statistics and the smoke run

`bench_input_path_lockstats` resets the lock counters as each run opens and reads them as it closes,
and prints, for the reported rep, every lock and thread role that took one: acquisitions, contended
acquisitions, failed `try_lock`s, the longest wait, the p99 wait from the log2 histogram, and the
longest hold. Its latencies carry a few clock reads per lock, so they are reported from
`bench_input_path` and only the locks from the twin. `--smoke` runs every scenario for 0.2 s, one
rep, no warm-up; ctest runs it as `bench_input_path_smoke` (or `bench_input_path_lockstats_smoke`)
with `--json`. Its exit code is the harness's own accounting, never a latency: every producer sent
and was heard, every frame left at or after its deadline with the median within 1 ms (streams of 8
frames or more), the GUI's reads ran, feedback reached the SDL queue, mic frames, the DualSense's
motion and touchpad, and the toggles happened, every datagram decrypted, and the results were
written.

## Caveats

- **One machine, loopback.** The satellite is a thread on the same CPU, so the figure includes the
  loopback stack. Blocking the receiver instead of spinning it added 4 to 9 us at 1 and 2 kHz.
- **Idle threads run the path cold.** Pad A alone cost about 5 us a report at 2 kHz, where its
  producer never sleeps, 15 to 17 us at 1 kHz and 35 us at 250 Hz, with a spinning receiver (single
  2 s runs of `--scenarios S1 --rate <hz>`). A thread that
  sleeps between reports, as the SDL thread does in its poll loop, meets cold caches; pad B's 250 Hz
  frames are due with pad A's and go out right behind them, which is why B reads 5 to 7 us.
- **Synthetic mode has no SDL thread on the path**: its pump, `rebuildState`, the output drain and
  the battery poll are only in ViGEm mode, where they are not separable from SDL's 1 ms sampling.
- **AppModel's glue is a mirror** (see above), and **a Direct pad's gateway is a fake**: the raw-HID
  read and write and their locks (`hid.claims`, `hid.write`) need hardware and are not exercised.
- **Default priority class and timer resolution**, other work on the machine as it happened:
  another agent's Gradle daemon and test runs were resident, and the CPU load sampled before and
  after each run was 0 to 5 percent. Compare runs of one binary on one machine.

The satellite saw 652.0 reports a second.

Every report pays five locks on its way out (`input.processor`, `app.routing`, `wifi.client`,
`satellite.material`, `satellite.send`) and three heap allocations (the routing's `QString`,
`sendEncrypted`'s two vectors), and `satellite.send` is held across `sendto`, for up to 176 us in
these runs. Nothing contends while one pad streams alone; the cost
appears when another thread shares a lock. The mic stream shares pad A's session: at 50 Hz pad A
waited on `satellite.send` 113 times in 3 s (up to 45 us), and at 1 kHz the SdlInput thread waited
on 2,560 of its 3,750 sends (up to 180 us), which takes pad A's median from 11.5 to 28.2 us. The receive thread takes `bridge.devices`
twice for every feedback message and meets the GUI's `devices()` reads there (waits up to 14 us in
S5), and the GUI's routing republish meets the SDL thread on `app.routing` (up to 10 us). A Direct
DualSense sends 2.22 datagrams per report: its touchpad goes out with every report, its motion at
the processor's 250 Hz cap. Through SDL, a 1 kHz pad is sampled every millisecond or so: 35 percent
of the stimulus reports were never sent, the rest arrived 530 us after XInput showed them at the
median and up to 1.1 ms after, and each sent two datagrams, one per stick axis SDL reported moved.

```
cmake --preset release -B build-bench-rel -DDISH_BUILD_BENCH=ON
cmake --build build-bench-rel --target bench_input_path
cmake --preset release -B build-bench-rel-lockstats -DDISH_BUILD_BENCH=ON -DDISH_LOCK_STATS=ON
cmake --build build-bench-rel-lockstats --target bench_input_path_lockstats

# Qt's bin directory on PATH, then from each build directory:
bench_input_path --json plain.json --csv plain.csv
bench_input_path --mic-hz 1000 --scenarios S5 --json plain-mic1000.json --csv plain-mic1000.csv
bench_input_path --mode vigem --json vigem.json --csv vigem.csv
bench_input_path_lockstats --json lockstats.json --csv lockstats.csv
