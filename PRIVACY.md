# Dish for Windows: Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-09-06.
**Canonical copy:** this file, at
[`https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-windows/blob/main/PRIVACY.md`](https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-windows/blob/main/PRIVACY.md).
The app links to it from Help, and the privacy index on
[dish.tinkernorth.com](https://dish.tinkernorth.com/privacy/) points here, so
the code and the policy ship together.

This document describes what data the Dish Windows client collects, why, how
long it is retained, and the choices you have over it. The product as a whole
spans several repositories (`satellite`, `dish-android`, `dish-windows`,
`dish-linux`, `dish-mac`); this policy is specific to the Windows desktop
client. The server (`satellite`) runs on your own PC and has its own policy.
The Android client has a separate policy and different behaviour, so do not
read one as describing the other.

---

## 1. Short version

- Dish for Windows turns a Windows PC into a wireless gamepad for a
  `satellite` server, or for a Moonlight host (Sunshine, Apollo, Wolf).
  Controller input goes from your PC, over your own network, to the host you
  paired with. It does not stream to any TinkerNorth-operated server.
  TinkerNorth does not operate a server for Dish at all.
- **Two things can leave your PC**, and you can turn both off: an update
  check against GitHub, described in section 2.4, and, when the app crashes,
  one crash report to Sentry, described in section 3. There is no analytics
  SDK, no telemetry, no advertising identifier, no usage reporting and no
  account. The update check asks GitHub for one file and sends no identifier
  with the request.
- Crash diagnostics are always written to your own disk, under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\`. With *Share crash reports* on (the default), an
  official build also sends one report per crash to Sentry: a stack trace, a
  minidump of the crashed process, and the app and Windows versions. Never
  your controller input, pairings or keys. Section 3 has the full list.
- Settings, remembered servers, and pairing keys live in your own Windows
  registry hive under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. Nothing is synced to a cloud
  account by the app.
- We do not sell, share, or rent your data. We do not show ads. We do not
  profile you.

## 2. What data is processed

### 2.1 Stays on your PC

Persisted with `QSettings`, which on Windows writes to the current user's
registry hive. The cross-client settings schema lands under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Dish\Dish`. Preferences that only exist on the
Windows desktop are written through the app's default organisation name and
land under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TinkerNorth\Dish` instead: the
window-chrome preference `ui_rail_collapsed` and the update settings listed
after the table.

| Registry value | Holds | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `satellite_list` | JSON array of remembered satellites: display name, IP, UDP port, HTTPS port, and the server's machine id | Reconnecting to hosts you already paired with |
| `satellite_shared_key:<id>` | **The libsodium-derived pairing key for that satellite**, hex encoded | Deriving the per-session ChaCha20-Poly1305 key for the gamepad wire protocol. This is secret material. Anyone with read access to your user hive can read it. |
| `satellite_cert_pin:<ip>` | SHA-256 fingerprint of the satellite's self-signed TLS certificate | Trust-on-first-use pinning, so a later HTTPS call is talking to the same box |
| `moonlight_host_list` | JSON array of remembered Moonlight hosts: display name, IP, HTTP and HTTPS ports, the host's id, the app last launched there, and whether pairing completed | Reconnecting to Moonlight (Sunshine, Apollo, Wolf) hosts you paired with |
| `moonlight_server_cert:<id>` | That Moonlight host's certificate, PEM | Pinning, so a later call is talking to the same host |
| `moonlight_binding_list` | Which controller slot is bound to which Moonlight host, and as which controller type | Restoring your setup |
| `moonlight_cert_pem`, `moonlight_key_pem`, `moonlight_uniqueid` | **This install's Moonlight client identity: a self-signed certificate, its private key, and a random client id** | Proving to a Moonlight host that this is the PC it paired with. Secret material, like the pairing key above. Sent **only** to Moonlight hosts you pair with, never to us. |
| `deviceId` | A random UUID generated on first run, with the dashes stripped | A stable per-install identifier the satellite uses to recognise this client across restarts and IP changes. It is sent **only** to satellites you pair with, never to us. |
| `deadzone:<deviceId>` | Per-controller stick and trigger deadzone profile | Restoring your calibration |
| `motion_enabled:<slotId>`, `motion_preferences`, `touchpad_mode_preferences` | Per-slot motion and touchpad routing toggles | Restoring your setup |
| `usb_path_choices` | Per `vid:pid` choice between the SDL path and the USB-direct raw-HID path | Restoring your setup |
| `joystick_remaps` | Per-device button, stick, and trigger remapping | Restoring your setup |
| `feature_lightbar_mode` | `followGame` or `off` | Light-bar behaviour |
| `theme_mode` | `system`, `light`, or `dark` | Appearance |
| `onboarding_welcome_completed`, `onboarding_dashboard_hint_dismissed` | Booleans | Not showing first-run screens again |
| `crashlytics_collection_enabled` | Boolean, default `true` | The *Share crash reports* switch; section 3. The key name is inherited from the Android client for schema continuity; this client reports to Sentry, not Crashlytics. |
| `ui_rail_collapsed` | Boolean | Navigation-rail width |

Legacy values `wifi_list` and `wifi_shared_key/<id>` from older builds are
migrated in place on first run so you do not have to re-pair.

These seven values live under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TinkerNorth\Dish` and cover the update feature
described in section 2.4. They record your choices and the app's own
bookkeeping. None of them is transmitted anywhere.

| Registry value | Holds | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `updates_check_enabled` | Boolean, default `true` | The *Check for updates automatically* switch. When off, the app makes no update-related network request at all. |
| `updates_auto_download` | Boolean, default `true` | The *Download updates automatically* switch. When off, the app checks and tells you, and downloads nothing until you ask. |
| `updates_skipped_version` | A version string, default empty | The one version you pressed *Skip this version* on, so it stops being offered |
| `updates_last_check_utc_ms` | Timestamp | Not checking more than once an hour at startup |
| `updates_handoff_version`, `updates_handoff_attempts` | A version string and a small counter | Internal apply bookkeeping: which staged update is being installed at the next start, and how many times it has been tried, so a broken update is abandoned after two attempts instead of looping |
| `updates_last_run_version` | A version string | Noticing that the app just updated, so it can say so once |

The app also keeps a folder at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\updates\`. It holds the
downloaded `dish-setup.exe`, a copy of the release manifest that described it,
and the installer's own log from the last apply attempt. Nothing in it is
personal, nothing in it is sent anywhere, and you can delete the folder at any
time; the app recreates it only when it downloads an update. The uninstaller
removes it.

**What the installer writes.** `dish-setup.exe` is a separate program from the
app (Inno Setup, compiled from [`installer.iss`](installer.iss)), and it
touches two more places on your PC. It creates the Add/Remove Programs entry
under
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\`
(or the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` equivalent for an all-users install), holding the
display name, version, publisher, install location, uninstall command and
estimated size that Windows shows you in Installed apps. And it creates the
shortcuts you asked for: a Start Menu entry and, if you turned it on, a
desktop one. The uninstaller (`unins000.exe`, beside `dish.exe`) removes all
three. [`docs/INSTALLER.md`](docs/INSTALLER.md) has the details.

The app also **reads** (never writes)
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize`
to follow your Windows light/dark setting.

Held in memory only, never written and never transmitted anywhere except to
the satellite you bound the controller to:

- Gamepad input events: buttons, sticks, triggers, motion, touchpad.
- Battery readings reported by a connected controller.
- Raw HID reports read from a controller in USB-direct mode.

The app reads input from connected game controllers, through SDL2 and, in
USB-direct mode, by reading raw HID input reports itself. It also writes back to
them: rumble and light-bar colour are sent through SDL2. The USB-direct path is
read-only. All of this is device IO on your own machine. It requires no
administrator rights and no driver install.

### 2.2 Sent to your own LAN, not to TinkerNorth

Everything the app puts on the network goes to a `satellite` server you chose,
on an address you can see in the app.

- **Discovery.** When you scan, the app sends a multicast DNS PTR query for
  `_satellite._udp.local.` to `224.0.0.251:5353`, and listens for the legacy
  UDP broadcast beacon on port 9879. The mDNS query contains the service name
  it is asking about and nothing about you. Both stay on your local network.
- **Pairing.** When you pair, the app makes an HTTPS `POST` to
  `/api/pair` on the satellite (port 9443 by default). The satellite presents
  a self-signed certificate, which the app pins on first use and checks on
  every later call. The request carries your device id, a device label, and
  either the PIN shown on the satellite or a PIN the app displays for you to
  type there. The response carries the shared pairing key, which is then
  stored as described above. `DELETE /api/pair` unpairs, which also removes
  the server-side record.
- **Control plane.** Once paired, the app calls the satellite's HTTPS API on
  the same port: `PUT`/`DELETE /api/connections` and
  `/api/connections/<id>/controllers/<slot>` to declare which controllers are
  bound and how they should be emulated, `GET /api/server/capabilities`, and
  `GET /api/catalog` for the localised list of emulatable controller types.
  These carry your device id, an HMAC proof computed from the pairing key, and
  your controller topology.
- **Gamepad stream.** The data plane is raw UDP to the satellite, port 9876
  by default, encrypted and authenticated with ChaCha20-Poly1305 under a
  session key derived from the pairing key (the pairing key itself never
  travels over UDP). Upstream frames carry controller state, motion, battery,
  and touchpad. Downstream frames carry rumble, light-bar colour, heartbeat
  acknowledgements, and session close.
- **Moonlight hosts.** Dish can also be the controller for a Sunshine, Apollo
  or Wolf host, speaking the Moonlight (GameStream) protocol instead of the
  satellite one. Hosts are found over mDNS (`_nvstream._tcp`) or added by
  address. Pairing follows that protocol: a few HTTP requests to the host on
  port 47989, which the protocol fixes as plain HTTP because no shared secret
  exists yet. The PIN never travels over the wire; both sides derive a key
  from it and prove they hold it. From then on every call is mutual TLS on
  port 47984 with this install's client certificate, and the host's
  certificate is pinned so a swapped host is refused. To open a controller
  session the app launches or resumes an app on the host, then sends your
  controller input, motion, touchpad and battery over the protocol's
  encrypted (AES-GCM) control channel. The host also streams its screen and
  audio at the lowest settings it allows, because the protocol needs a stream
  to hold the session open; Dish discards those packets without decoding
  them and never stores or shows them. The host learns this install's client
  id, a device name and the client certificate. All of this stays on your
  local network.

Windows may prompt you once for a firewall exception so the app can send and
receive on your local network. Granting it affects your LAN only.

### 2.3 Sent to TinkerNorth or a third party

There is no TinkerNorth server for this app to talk to. The one thing that
reaches us is a crash report, through Sentry, and only if you leave *Share
crash reports* on.

Two things leave your network by default, and you can turn both off. The
update check described in **section 2.4** goes to GitHub: a plain HTTPS
request for a file on the public releases page, with no identifier. A crash
report, described in **section 3**, goes to Sentry, which processes it for
us, and only when the app has actually crashed.

Beyond those there is no analytics library, no error tracking beyond the
crash report, and no advertising identifier. Apart from the updater and the
crash reporter, the only component in the app that makes an outbound HTTPS
request is the satellite API client, and it only ever addresses the IP of a
satellite you selected.

The other way this app causes a request to a TinkerNorth or third-party
address is if you click a link, which hands the URL to your default browser
and is then between you and that site. Those links are:

| Where | Opens |
|---|---|
| Help, privacy policy | `https://github.com/TinkerNorth/dish-windows/blob/main/PRIVACY.md` |
| Help, project page | `https://github.com/TinkerNorth` |
| Welcome, Connections, and the setup wizard, when you have no server yet | `https://dish.tinkernorth.com/downloads/satellite` |
| Support links | `https://github.com/sponsors/TinkerNorth`, `https://ko-fi.com/tinkernorth`, `https://buymeacoffee.com/tinkernorth` |

The app does not embed a browser and does not pass any identifier along with
these URLs.

### 2.4 Update check (GitHub)

When *Check for updates automatically* is on, which is the default, the app
sends an HTTPS `GET` to `github.com` for the file `latest.json` attached to the
newest release of this project. GitHub answers with a redirect to its own
download CDN, so the request finishes against
`objects.githubusercontent.com`. The file is about a kilobyte of JSON: a
version number, a download URL, a size and a SHA-256 checksum.

**When it happens.** About 15 seconds after you launch the app, at most once
an hour; every four hours while the app stays open; and whenever you press
*Check for updates* in Settings. Nothing runs while the app is closed. There is
no service, no scheduled task, and no update agent.

**What the request carries.** Your IP address, as GitHub sees it, which is
unavoidable for any HTTPS request. A `User-Agent` header of the form
`Dish/<version> (Windows; x64)`. Nothing else. No device id, no account data,
no settings, no usage data, no cookies, no query parameters, and no
conditional-request identifiers. GitHub's own
[privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
governs what GitHub logs about the request.

**Downloading.** With *Download updates automatically* also on, the app then
fetches `dish-setup.exe` from the same GitHub release, to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\updates\`. That is one more request to the same host, with
the same headers, and the downloaded file is checked against the SHA-256 in the
manifest before it is ever run. Metered connections are skipped until you are
on an unmetered one. With that switch off, the app tells you a new version
exists and downloads nothing until you ask.

**Turning it off.** *Check for updates automatically* is the master switch. Off
means the app makes no update-related network request of any kind, arms no
timer, and creates no network stack for it. The portable zip never downloads or
applies an update at all; it only tells you one exists.

The registry values behind these switches are in section 2.1, and the
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\updates\` folder is described there too.

---

## 3. Crash reports

This is the part most likely to be misread, so it is stated plainly.

**What is written locally, always.** The app installs a Win32 unhandled
exception filter. When the process crashes it writes two files to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\`:

- `crash.dmp`, a minidump containing data segments, handle data, and thread
  info for the crashed process.
- `crash.log`, a text file with a UTC timestamp, the exception code, the
  faulting address and module, and a best-effort symbolised stack.

Both files stay on your disk and are overwritten by the next crash. A
minidump is a snapshot of a process, so it can contain whatever the app held
in memory at that moment, including the satellite address you were connected
to and, in principle, key material. Treat `crash.dmp` as sensitive and
consider that before you attach it to a public issue. Delete the folder at any
time; the app recreates it only if it crashes again.

Debug builds additionally route MSVC debug-CRT assertion failures into the
same `crash.log`.

**What is uploaded, and when.** Settings has a *Share crash reports* switch,
on by default. With it on, an official release build that crashes sends one
report to [Sentry](https://sentry.io), a crash-reporting service operated by
Functional Software, Inc. (San Francisco, USA), which processes it on our
behalf. The report is produced by the Sentry native SDK, which the app arms
only after reading your preference, and contains:

- the stack of the crashing thread and the list of loaded modules with their
  versions, so we can see where it failed;
- a minidump of the crashed process: register state and the stack memory of
  its threads, not a full memory image. Stack memory can contain fragments
  of whatever the app held at that moment, which in principle includes the
  address of the satellite you were connected to;
- the app version and a build environment label, the Windows version and
  CPU architecture, and a random event id.

It does **not** contain your controller input, your pairings, keys or
settings, your Windows user name, or a device identifier, and the app never
reports launches, sessions or usage: the crash is the only event. Sentry sees
the public IP address of your PC when it receives the report, as any web
service does; the app does not attach it and we do not use it. Sentry retains
crash data for 90 days, then deletes it. We use Sentry's US region, so the
data is stored in the United States. See Sentry's
[privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) for its role as a processor.

**Opting out.** Turn *Share crash reports* off. The switch disarms the SDK
immediately, so it stops the very next report, not just later ones, and the
choice persists in the registry. Opting out never costs you the local files
above.

**Builds that cannot upload.** Only official releases from this repository
carry the Sentry address (DSN) that the SDK needs. A source build, a
pull-request build or a fork carries none and cannot upload, whatever the
switch says.

**Symbols.** To make reports readable we upload the debug symbols of official
builds to Sentry at release time. They describe the program, not you.

## 4. Windows capabilities the app uses

Windows desktop apps do not declare a permission manifest the way Android
apps do, so this is the equivalent list of what the app touches.

| Capability | Why |
|---|---|
| Network sockets: UDP multicast, UDP broadcast listen, UDP unicast, TCP, TLS over TCP | Discovery, pairing, control plane, gamepad stream, for satellites and Moonlight hosts alike. All to your LAN. |
| HTTPS to `github.com` | The update check and, if enabled, the update download. Section 2.4. Only while *Check for updates automatically* is on. |
| Game-controller device enumeration and IO | Reading controller input, and writing rumble and light-bar output back to the controller. Raw HID access is used for reading in USB-direct mode. |
| `SetThreadExecutionState` | Preventing sleep while a controller is actively streaming, so input latency stays low. Released when streaming stops. |
| `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` registry read and write | Settings and pairing state, as listed in section 2.1. |
| `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\` file write | The crash dump and crash log, and the `updates\` folder described in section 2.1. |
| Default browser launch | Opening the links listed in section 2.3, only when you click one. |

The app runs as a normal user. It does not request elevation, does not
install a service or a driver, does not read your files, and does not access
the microphone, camera, location, contacts, or clipboard. The one exception to
elevation is an all-users install: applying an update to an installation under
`Program Files` needs administrator rights, so the installer asks for them once
with the standard Windows prompt, and a declined prompt simply leaves the old
version running. A per-user install, which is the default, never prompts.

---

## 5. Your choices

- **Forget a satellite.** Removing a satellite deletes its remembered row,
  its stored pairing key, and its certificate pin from the registry, and
  unpairs on the server so any live session is closed there too.
- **Forget a Moonlight host.** Removing it deletes its row, its pinned
  certificate and its bindings from the registry. The host keeps its own
  list of paired clients; clear it in that host's settings.
- **Stop crash reports being sent.** Settings, *Share crash reports*, off.
  The local files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\` are still written; delete the
  folder whenever you like.
- **Stop the update check.** Settings, Updates, *Check for updates
  automatically*. Off means no update-related request leaves your machine, at
  any time, for any reason. Leaving it on but turning off *Download updates
  automatically* keeps the check and stops the download.
- **Delete the update cache.** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\updates\` can go at any
  time. The app recreates it only when it downloads an update, and deleting a
  partly-downloaded update simply makes it start over.
- **Uninstall.** Windows Settings, Installed apps (or `unins000.exe` beside
  `dish.exe`) removes the program files, the shortcuts, the Add/Remove
  Programs entry and the update cache. Your settings, pairings and crash files
  are deliberately left behind so that reinstalling restores your setup; the
  *Wipe everything* step below removes those too.
- **Wipe everything.** Delete `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Dish\Dish` and
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TinkerNorth\Dish`, and delete
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dish\`. That removes every remembered server, pairing key,
  certificate pin, Moonlight identity, preference, update setting, and crash
  artifact. There is no server-side record to delete, because there is no
  TinkerNorth server.
- **Verify any of this.** The client is free software under
  [LGPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). Every claim above is checkable in this
  repository, and you can build the binary yourself. See
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## 6. Children's privacy

Dish is suitable for general audiences. The app collects nothing from anyone,
of any age, beyond the crash report described in section 3, so there is no
children's data for us to hold. If you believe that is wrong in some way we
have not anticipated, contact `privacy@tinkernorth.com`.

---

## 7. International transfers

Crash reports, when enabled, are stored by Sentry in the United States
(section 3). The update check goes to GitHub, also in the United States.
Nothing else leaves your machine to us.

---

## 8. Changes to this policy

We will update the *Effective date* at the top whenever this policy changes.
Material changes, such as any new analytics backend, will be made here
before the code ships and will be called out in that release's notes in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Previous
versions remain in the git history of this file.
