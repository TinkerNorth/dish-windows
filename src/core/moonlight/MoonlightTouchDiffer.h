// Turns the pad's FULL-STATE touch frame into the EVENT stream a Moonlight host
// expects.
//
// The two protocols disagree about what a touch sample is, and that disagreement
// is the whole reason this file exists. A DualShock 4 / DualSense report carries
// "here is where both fingers are right now", and the satellite forwards exactly
// that, loss-safely, every frame. CONTROLLER_TOUCH instead carries "this pointer
// went down / moved / came up", and the host holds the contact open until an UP
// arrives. Feeding one into the other unchanged would either strand a contact
// forever (no UP is ever generated) or re-DOWN it on every report.
//
// So the differ owns the last frame and emits only transitions. It is a pure
// value type: one instance per (session, controller), reset when the pad or the
// session goes away, and every rule below is directly testable.
//
// Loss: the satellite path can drop a frame safely because the next one carries
// the whole truth. This path cannot, which is fine, because the Moonlight
// control stream is reliable (ENet, ordered). A dropped frame here would strand
// a contact, so the events must not ride an unreliable channel.
