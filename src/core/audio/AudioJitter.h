// Reorder window for one direction of one controller's audio stream
// (kMsgSpeakerAudio inbound here, kMsgMicAudio on the satellite): wrapping u16
// sequence numbers in, in-order packets and explicit gap signals out.
//
// The streams are lossy by contract (satellite docs/contract.md: no acks, no
// retransmits), so `seq` buys exactly two things and no more: it says which
// frames never arrived, so the decoder can conceal them, and it says which
// arrived too late to matter, so they can be dropped instead of spliced in
// behind audio already played.
//
// This is the THIRD deliberate mirror of satellite src/core/audio/audio_jitter.h
// (dish-android cpp/audio_jitter.h is the second), rule for rule and name for
// name: both ends of one stream have to agree on what counts as lost, what
// counts as late, and how long a hole is worth concealing, and the only way to
// keep that true is to keep the files the same shape. Edit the three together.
// The constant spellings are the mirrors' own, not this repo's k-prefix, so the
// files diff clean against each other.
//
// Dependency-free: std only, no Protocol.h, no Qt. The ordering rules are the
// sort of thing that should be provable on their own.
