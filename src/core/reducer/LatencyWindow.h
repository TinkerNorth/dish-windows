// slide through a fixed 64-sample window; the displayed one-way latency is the
// window median halved (symmetric-path estimate), so the figure answers "now",
// not "since the session opened". Mirrors dish-android hotpath_latency.cpp
// (kRttWindow=64, shouldArmPing's in-flight guard + loss reclaim, addRttSample's
// validity clamp) + LatencyPanel (networkOneWayP50Ms = p50/2, sample count shown).
//
// Pure C++17, Qt-free, allocation-free: the window is a fixed std::array ring
// and the median sorts a stack copy. There is no clock inside — SatelliteClient
// stamps ping instants from its own monotonic clock and passes the deltas in,
// the same caller-supplies-timing rule InputRateTracker follows.
