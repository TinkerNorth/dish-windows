// QML type identities for the view-model types that live in dish_core.
//
// dish_core deliberately links no Qml: the tests exercise AppViewModel and the
// two role models without the Quick stack, so those classes cannot carry
// QML_ELEMENT themselves. These QML_FOREIGN declarations do it for them from
// the Dish target, which is the Dish.Chrome module's backing target, so
// qmltyperegistrar writes the types into the module's generated qmltypes. That
// is what lets qmllint resolve `App.statusText` and friends statically instead
// of reporting every one of them as an unqualified access.
//
// They do NOT replace the runtime registrations in QmlEntryPoint. Under this
// target's LTCG the generated QQmlModuleRegistration initializer is stripped,
// so a declarative-only name may never reach the engine at all. App's create()
// therefore hands back the very instance QmlEntryPoint registered by value:
// whichever of the two registrations the engine resolves, QML sees one object.
