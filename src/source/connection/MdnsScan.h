// One multicast-DNS query and the answers to it. Windows exposes no COM-free
// mDNS browse API, so both discoverers speak the protocol directly, and this is
// the part of that they share: the socket, the query, and the receive window.
//
// What they do NOT share is the query bytes, the record parse, and what counts
// as the same responder twice. Those stay with each discoverer, which is why
// this takes a callback rather than a record type.
//
// No winsock in this header on purpose: it is included from the two discoverers
// and nothing else should have to see windows.h to call a scan.
