// The Windows USB-direct claim driver: the imperative coordinator that executes

// performs USB IO.
//
// XInput hides Xbox-class pads from raw HID, so an Xbox 360/One/Series pad bound
// to XInput does not appear to a raw-HID enumerator at all. This path therefore
// serves HID pads (DualSense, DualShock 4, 8BitDo) and Xbox pads stay on
// SDL/XInput. A model that fails to claim falls back to the SDL path, so
// USB-direct is strictly additive and never a regression.
//
// Hot-path discipline: the Gateway read loop feeds decoded reports straight into
// GamepadInputProcessor::publish, the same entry point the SDL bridge uses, with
// no Qt signals on the per-report path. All FSM mutation is serialized through
// applyEvent so events apply in order.
